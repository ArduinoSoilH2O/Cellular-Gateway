# Cellular-Gateway-Network
In 2017 researchers at the USDA Beltsville Agricultural Research Center developed a LoRa TM Gateway Node data logging network to colelct and store hourly data from soil moisture sensors installed at on-farm experimental plots along the East Coast. 

This repository contains materials related to the updates made to the Node and Cellular Gateway soil moisture data logging network in 2018.

Updates:
 - New Gateway design including Adafruit FONA 3G module to send received data to ThingSpeak
 - Time synchronization between Gateway and Nodes
 - Improved user menus
 - Selectable measurement interval
 - Power regulation

Materials included in repository:
- Node sketch
- Gateway sketch
- List of libraries new to 2018 sketches
- Schematics
- List of components
